# order-summary-component

It has been almost a month since I have worked on a Frontend Mentor challenge, and I believe
I still have a lot to learn when using Javascript. Therefore, I'm going to be completing a few
more challenge that are exclusively HTML and CSS only.

This challenge was very simple, which made me implement a simple flex/grid layout as needed.
The hardest part about this challenge was the payment plan section, where the music note icon, prices
and change link were located.
